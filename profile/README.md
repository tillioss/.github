## About Tilli

Tilli is a play-based, social-emotional learning tool that brings together the joys of play and the power of behavioural science to help kids (alongside their caregivers and teachers) build foundational, lifelong skills and mindsets to be stay, safe and happy

We’re currently working with the UNICEF Innovation Fund to create Tilli's Safety Toolbox. It is a three module, play-based learning experience on Social-Emotional Learning for Child Online Safety. The focus of this project is to help parents and caregivers have meaningful conversations with their children and teachers, educators and social workers deliver powerful learning to their students!

## Joining the Tilli Community 
We are a community of learning designers, game designers, developers and educators with an interest in designing game-based, social emotional learning experience for kids. We create an environment where our community can effectively explore, create innovative and open aid distribution technology services that are inclusive, accountable, and accessible for everyone.
